  <p>You go to music festivals because of the music. That should be a given, but the rise of street style has shifted the focus a little. (Okay, maybe a lot.) Luckily, the Meadows Music and Arts Festival debuted with a solid formula: smaller grounds, well-placed stages, and a truly transformative and diverse lineup. It put the focus on discovering new artists and reaffirmed why your faves are your faves. Plus, with the Meadows being a music and arts festival, there was plenty of art (which, in true New York fashion, was graffiti) to fill your Instagram feed for days. 
    Ahead, relive the most magical, extraordinary moments from this year’s inaugural go-around. Until next festival season, we’ll be hibernating with our headphones and retreating to our comfort places. The crowds have taken their toll on our souls.
